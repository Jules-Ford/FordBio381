**Problem 4**

So in Part B I found that the probability distribution that fit my data best was uniform. So, in order to generate new data, I'm going to need to use the `runif()` function. From the data in Part B, I found the maximum likelihood parameters: `n=30`, `min=0.58`, `max=13.02`.

Now, I'm going to plug those values into the function:

```{r}
runif(30, min=0.58, max=13.02)
```

*I still need to finish the rest of this problem!*
