**Problem 4**

So in Part B I found that the probability distribution that fit my data best was uniform. So, in order to generate new data, I'm going to need to use the `runif()` function. From the data in Part B, I found the maximum likelihood parameters: `n=30`, `min=0.58`, `max=13.02`.

Now, I'm going to plug those values into the function:

```{r}
library(ggplot2) # for graphics
library(MASS) # for maximum likelihood estimation

# Plot of the new data
newGraph <- runif(30, min=0.58, max=13.02)


# This is the code from Part B that plots the original histogram
voleData <- read.table("hwk7Data.csv",header=TRUE,sep=",")
p1 <- ggplot(data=voleData, aes(x=Initial.plant.volume..m3., y=..density..)) +
  geom_histogram(color="grey60",fill="cornsilk",linewidth=0.2) # This sets up the histogram

xval <- seq(0,max(voleData$Initial.plant.volume..m3.),len=length(voleData$Initial.plant.volume..m3.)) # This grabs the variable needed for plotting the curve
stat3 <- stat_function(aes(x = xval, y = ..y..), fun = dunif, colour="darkgreen", n = length(voleData$Initial.plant.volume..m3.), args = list(min=min(voleData$Initial.plant.volume..m3.), max=max(voleData$Initial.plant.volume..m3.))) # This is the code for the curve
 
p1 <-  p1 +  stat3 # This combines the plot and the curve
print(p1) # This prints everything

```

Question to answer: How do the two histogram profiles compare? Do you think the model is doing a good job of simulating realistic data that match your original measurements? Why or why not?
