**Problem 1**
```{r}
vec <- c(8, 4, 0, 10, 900, 4, 0)

####################################
# FUNCTION: zeroCalculator
# packages: none
# purpose: determine the number of zeros inside a numeric vector
# input: a numeric vector
# output: the number of zeros inside the numeric vector
#----------------------------
crazyZeroCalculator <- function(vec) {
  counter <- 0
  betterVec <- paste(vec, collapse="")
  betterVec <- strsplit(betterVec, split="")
  for (i in seq_along(betterVec[[1]])) {
    if (betterVec[[1]][i] == "0") {
     counter <- counter + 1
    }
  }
  return(counter)
}

check <- crazyZeroCalculator(vec) 
print(check)
```
This problem requires us to take a vector and determine the number of zeroes in that vector. To make this function, I used the `paste()` function so I could collapse the vector into a single character string with no spaces. Then, I used the `strsplit()` function to separate each character from that string into its own character string object. Then, using a for loop, I checked whether that object was the character string `"0"` and if it was, I added 1 to the counter variable (the running total of zeroes in that vector).
